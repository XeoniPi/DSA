This repository contains my journey through Data Structures &amp; Algorithms. It includes implementations of fundamental structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and algorithmic techniques (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking). Each file is well-documented with comments and sample test cases.
